# Releasing

Releases of `dynamo-protocols`, `dynamo-parsers`, `dynamo-parsers-v2`,
`dynamo-tokenizers`, and `dynamo-renderer` to crates.io are automated by
`.github/workflows/release.yml`. This document covers what the workflow does,
what one-time setup it requires, and how to recover when it goes wrong.

## What happens on every push to `main`

1. The `release` workflow runs.
2. The workflow decides **per crate, path-scoped** (DIS-2414). For each publishable workspace crate it compares the crate's `Cargo.toml` version against the crate's latest release tag (e.g. `dynamo-protocols-v2.0.2`):
   - **version ≠ last tag** → the version was **manually pegged** in a PR. The workflow does not touch it; the publish step ships exactly that version. See "Manual version peg" below.
   - **version == last tag, no changes under the crate's own directory** since that tag → nothing happens. In particular, a change to one crate never re-releases its dependents: all inter-crate deps are caret reqs, so a compatible bump never requires a dependent re-release (the old blanket `release-plz update` cascaded these, churning versions of crates whose code never changed).
   - **version == last tag, changes under the crate's own directory** → `release-plz update -p <crate>` bumps that crate only. Within the crate, release-plz still applies its own two filters: only **packaged contents** count (the `include = [...]` list in the crate's `Cargo.toml`: `src/**/*`, `Cargo.toml`, `README.md` — not `tests/` etc.), and only commits matching `release_commits` in `release-plz.toml` count (`feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `sync:`, plus — temporarily, for the dynamo→frontend-crates transition — `chore:`). If neither filter passes, no bump is proposed even though the directory changed.
3. If any bumps were proposed, the workflow commits them with an informative
   subject listing every crate whose version changed this run — e.g.
   `chore: release dynamo-protocols v1.4.0, dynamo-renderer v1.3.1` (with
   `Signed-off-by:` for DCO) — and pushes to `main`.
4. `release-plz release` always runs (not gated on step 3 — a merge that only
   manually pegged a version produces no bump commit but must still publish).
   It publishes every crate whose `Cargo.toml` version isn't on crates.io yet
   and creates the per-crate git tags; it's a no-op otherwise. GitHub Releases
   are disabled (`git_release_enable = false`); the per-crate `CHANGELOG.md`
   files plus the `*-v*` tags are the release record.
5. The push from step 3 retriggers the workflow. A recursion guard on the
   `chore: release` commit message short-circuits the second run.

## Manual version peg (fixture-synced releases)

To release a crate at a **specific, deliberate version** — e.g. so a conformance fixture snapshot (`conformance/fixtures/`, git-lfs) and the crates.io release carry the same pegged number — edit the crate's `version` in its `Cargo.toml` in your PR (any jump you want: patch, minor, major). On merge, the workflow sees the version differs from the last release tag, skips any auto-bump for that crate, and publishes exactly that version. `Cargo.toml` is the single source of truth: fixture provenance embeds the built crate's version, so both artifacts stay in sync by construction.

The same mechanism covers a crate's **first release**: a crate with no release tag yet is never auto-bumped — set its version manually and merge.

Note: a manual peg skips the auto-changelog; add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry in the same PR if the release warrants one.

## Bump policy

release-plz applies SemVer to the Conventional Commits since each crate's last
tag. SemVer treats `0.x` versions specially (the minor slot is the de-facto
breaking position), so the bump depends on whether a crate has reached `1.0.0`.

`dynamo-protocols`, `dynamo-parsers`, `dynamo-tokenizers`, and
`dynamo-renderer` are all at `1.x`+ (standard SemVer):

| Commit                          | Bump from 1.3.0 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`    | 1.3.1 (patch)   |
| `feat:`                         | 1.4.0 (minor)   |
| `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:`   | 2.0.0 (major)   |
| `chore:`, `ci:`, `build:`, etc. | no bump         |

`dynamo-parsers-v2` is at `0.x`, where the minor slot is the breaking position (cargo treats `0.1.21 -> 0.2.0` as breaking, `0.1.21 -> 0.1.22` as compatible), so compatible changes bump the patch slot and breaking changes bump the minor slot. Lifecycle note: v1 (`dynamo-parsers`) is interim and will be removed outright once v2 reaches parity; v2 is the ultimate implementation (WIP), so expect its `0.x` line to keep moving while v1 stays quiet. Downstream exact pins like vLLM's `dynamo-parsers-v2 = "=0.1.x"` only move when their owners update them — another reason auto-bumps stay scoped to crates whose own code changed.

### What `cargo-semver-checks` validates

After release-plz picks a bump, it runs `cargo-semver-checks` against the
last published version on crates.io. If the proposed bump is too small for
the API change it sees, the workflow fails before publishing anything.

- **Catches:** removed/renamed pub items, signature changes, narrowed
  visibility, removed trait method defaults, and similar structural breaks
  that were labeled `fix:`/`chore:` instead of `feat!:`.
- **Does NOT catch:** behavioral changes with unchanged signatures, new
  panic conditions, MSRV bumps, dependency-surface drift, some trait
  default-impl subtleties. For these, the contributor must label the commit
  `feat!:` / `fix!:` themselves.

When `cargo-semver-checks` fails, fix the underlying commit: open a PR that
amends or adds a follow-up commit with the correct label (e.g. add a
`feat!:` or `fix!:` with a `BREAKING CHANGE:` trailer), merge, and the next
workflow run will pick up the right bump.

## One-time setup (bootstrap)

These admin actions must be done before the workflow can run end-to-end.

1. **Create the `automated-release` GitHub Environment.** Repo Settings →
   Environments → New environment → name `automated-release`. Configure:
   - **Deployment branches:** Selected branches → `main` only. Prevents
     publishes from PR branches even if a workflow file is added there.
   - **Required reviewers:** leave empty. (Adding reviewers would force a
     manual click on every release, defeating the direct-release flow.)
   - **Wait timer:** leave at 0.
   - **Environment secrets:** the app ID and private key provisioned in step
     3 below should live here, not at repo level, so other workflows can't
     read them.

2. **Configure trusted publishing on crates.io.** For each published crate
   (`dynamo-protocols`, `dynamo-parsers`, `dynamo-parsers-v2`,
   `dynamo-tokenizers`, `dynamo-renderer`), go to
   crates.io → crate Settings → Trusted Publishers → add a GitHub trusted
   publisher with:
   - Repository: `ai-dynamo/frontend-crates`
   - Workflow filename: `release.yml`
   - **Environment: `automated-release`** — binds the OIDC claim to this
     environment so requests from anywhere else are rejected.

3. **Provision release GitHub App credentials (in the `automated-release`
   environment).** The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push to a protected
   branch nor trigger downstream workflows (CI on the release commit).
   Create a small GitHub App with `Contents: write` permissions and install
   it on only this repo. Then add:
   - **Environment secret:** `RELEASE_APP_ID` with the app's Client ID.
   - **Environment secret:** `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` with the full private
     key file contents, including the begin/end lines.
   The workflow uses `actions/create-github-app-token` to mint a short-lived
   installation token for checkout, pushing release commits, and release-plz
   GitHub API calls.

4. **Branch protection on `main`:** require CI status checks, require
   linear history, require DCO. Add the release GitHub App to the ruleset
   bypass list with "Always allow" so it can push the `chore: release`
   commit directly. Human commits still go through PRs.

5. **Tag protection:** add a tag protection rule matching `*-v*` to
   prevent updates and deletes.

## Recovery: partial publish failure

If the workflow publishes `dynamo-protocols` but fails on
`dynamo-tokenizers` (e.g. crates.io throttling, transient network error,
late-failing `cargo-semver-checks`):

1. The `chore: release` commit is already on `main` and the
   `dynamo-protocols-v<version>` tag exists.
2. Rerun the workflow via **Actions → release → Run workflow**. The
   `workflow_dispatch` trigger bypasses the recursion guard. `release-plz
   release` is idempotent: it checks crates.io and skips already-published
   crates, then retries the failed one.
3. If the rerun still fails, publish manually from a local checkout:
   ```
   cargo publish -p dynamo-tokenizers --token "$CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN"
   git tag -s -m "release dynamo-tokenizers <version>" \
       dynamo-tokenizers-v<version>
   git push origin dynamo-tokenizers-v<version>
   ```
   You'll need to recreate the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret temporarily
   for this, then remove it again.

## Manual hotfix

To ship a fix outside the normal merge flow (e.g. a security patch on a
single crate):

1. Cut a branch from the latest release tag of the affected crate.
2. Make the fix, commit with the appropriate Conventional Commit type
   (`fix:` for a patch, `feat!:` for a breaking emergency).
3. Open a PR to `main`, merge.
4. The workflow handles the rest.

If `main` has unreleased changes you don't want to ship yet, that's a
sign the normal flow is broken — investigate before reaching for branch
gymnastics.

## Upstream sync commits

`sync(<crate>):` commits modify packaged source under `<crate>/src/`, so
they trigger releases. By default this maps to a patch bump. If an upstream
sync introduces a breaking API change, the human running `sync-from-dynamo.sh`
must amend the commit message to `sync!(<crate>):` or add a
`BREAKING CHANGE:` trailer so the right bump is chosen. If
`cargo-semver-checks` catches a structural break that wasn't labeled
correctly, the publish will fail and you'll need to follow up with a
correctly-labeled commit (see "What `cargo-semver-checks` validates"
above).
