# conformance

Parser conformance fixtures, fixture-based Rust tests, and HTML renderers for frontend-crates.

## Ownership

Parser v1/v2 terminology, migration steps, fixture ownership, and temporary sync rules are documented in [`../docs/PARSERS-V2-MIGRATION-PLAN.md`](../docs/PARSERS-V2-MIGRATION-PLAN.md). New streaming parser authors should also read [`../parsers/v2/README.md`](../parsers/v2/README.md); it explains the vLLM-shaped Rust parser contract, the v2 fixture schema, and the exact `conformance/toolcalling/*` files to add. This README covers conformance layout, render outputs, and test commands.

## Parser paths and modes (universal convention)

- **Dynamo v1** = the batch parser, used two ways: **batch** (the complete text parsed in one call) and **jail+batch** (streaming input is buffered — "jailed" — until a call completes, then batch-parsed and emitted all at once). The jail never streams a call's name/arguments incrementally; only text outside the jail passes through as it arrives.
- **Dynamo v2** = the **streaming** parser (primary mode): emits text and tool-call deltas per chunk, as input arrives. It can also take batch input (the whole text fed as one chunk) — the `batch-on-stream` rows.
- **Per-chunk cells show WHEN output reaches the consumer.** Streaming parsers emit whenever something is parseable, so their cells carry deltas at real chunk positions. The v1 jail bursts at end-of-call — its captures record emission order, not per-chunk timing — so its per-chunk cells stay `—` with a "(bursts at end of call; per-chunk timing not recorded)" header note, and its output appears only in the `assembled` row.
- In the rendered tables, the TC (stream) tab's **default Reference is Dynamo v1 (jail+batch)** — the one stream path with coverage on every family — so every row shows data by default. Star **Dynamo v2** as the Reference to see v2's streaming coverage; families v2 doesn't implement yet gray out as "not implemented".

## Layout

```
conformance/
├── fixtures-manifest.json                         # pins the active fixture snapshot (sha256 per shard)
├── fixtures/                                      # LFS-tracked shard tarballs (the fixture store)
├── tests/*.rs                                     # Rust fixture tests (fixtures extracted from the store on first run)
└── utils/                                         # render, check, and record helpers
```

Fixture YAMLs are not loose in the repo. They live in `conformance/fixtures/` as git-lfs tarball shards (run `git lfs pull` on a fresh clone) and are extracted into `~/.cache/dynamo/conformance-fixtures/` automatically on first use. Snapshot layout:

```
toolcalling/fixtures-batch-v1/<family>/           # v1 tool-calling batch cases
toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/<family>/          # v2 stream cases
toolcalling/fixtures-batch-on-stream-v2/<family>/ # v2 complete-text-through-stream cases
reasoning/fixtures-v1/inputs/<family>/            # v1 reasoning cases
```

**Capture version dirs are append-only — NEVER delete or overwrite an existing `<impl>-<version>/` dir when re-recording.** Every version dir (`dynamo_v1-3.0.0` AND `dynamo_v2-0.1.11` AND `dynamo_v2-0.1.22`, `vllm_python-0.23.0` AND `vllm_python-0.24.0`, …) is capture history: the chart renders each one as a comparison candidate, and readers fold them ascending WITHIN an impl so the latest capture wins per case (`dynamo_v1` and `dynamo_v2` are separate impls and never fold together). Re-recording after a parser change writes the CURRENT crate version's dir alongside the old ones (`refresh_dynamo_captures.py` / `capture_dynamo_jail_stream.py` do this); re-recording at the same version replaces that one dir only. Deleting an old version dir silently destroys the chart's version-comparison columns — it happened once (version dirs were wiped by a refresh and had to be restored) and the tooling has since been made additive. If a dir looks obsolete, it still is not yours to delete: the git-lfs store keeps it, and the manifest-pinned snapshot is what the chart shows.

## Render Outputs

| Output | Command | Parser version | Fixture version |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 parity HTML | `conformance/utils/render_table_v1.sh` | v1 Dynamo-synced parser code through old Dynamo `generate_parity_table.py` | v1 Dynamo-synced tool-calling and reasoning fixtures; output stays under `conformance/utils/.stage/tests/parity/PARITY_v1.html` so old relative links resolve. |
| v2 conformance HTML | `conformance/utils/render_table_v2.sh` | Mixed bridge table: `TC batch (v1)` and reasoning tabs use v1 Dynamo-synced parser code; `TC batch-on-stream (v2)` and `TC stream (v2)` use Dynamo parser v2 code. | `TC batch (v1)` uses v1 batch fixtures; `TC batch-on-stream (v2)` uses v1 batch fixtures plus v2 batch-on-stream overlays; `TC stream (v2)` uses v2 stream fixtures; reasoning tabs use v1 reasoning fixtures. The default example output is `conformance/CONFORMANCE_v2.html`, and the render script also accepts a custom output path. |

## Running the tests

Use the repo's pinned toolchain (Rust 1.96.1 via rustup; a system `cargo` may be too old for the workspace):

```bash
# tool-calling batch parity, all families:
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-conformance-fixtures-v2 --test parity_toolcalling

# same, but print fixture names and the per-run case count:
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-conformance-fixtures-v2 --test parity_toolcalling -- --nocapture

# as part of the whole workspace (what CI runs):
cargo test --workspace
```

The test package is named `dynamo-conformance-fixtures-v2` for historical compatibility, but the code ownership still follows the v1/v2 split.

**Lifecycle:** v1 (`dynamo-parsers`, batch + jail) is **interim** — once v2 reaches parity, v1 is removed outright (not merged). v2 (`dynamo-parsers-v2`, streaming-first) is the **ultimate implementation, currently WIP**. New parser work goes to v2. The v1 fixture trees and parity tests exist to hold the line until then; expect them to be deleted together with v1.

| Test | Code under test | Fixtures | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `parity_toolcalling` | v1 Dynamo-synced batch parser in `parsers/src/tool_calling/` | v1 batch fixtures (`toolcalling/fixtures-batch-v1/`) | Each `batch` case's `model_text` is fed through `detect_and_parse_tool_call_with_recovery(text, Some(family), tools)` and compared to `expected.dynamo_v1`. |
| `parity_toolcalling_batch_via_stream` | Dynamo parser v2 in `parsers_v2/src/tool_calling/*` | v1 batch fixtures (`toolcalling/fixtures-batch-v1/`) plus v2 overlays (`toolcalling/fixtures-batch-on-stream-v2/`) | Feeds complete batch text into the v2 stream parser and compares assembled calls to the batch-on-stream expectations. |
| `parity_toolcalling_stream` | Dynamo parser v2 in `parsers_v2/src/tool_calling/*` | v2 stream fixtures (`toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/`) | Checks token-id or text streaming paths per chunk, then checks assembled calls. |

The fixture `family` field is the parser name, the same value Dynamo's `parse_tool_calls_batch` binding takes for v1. Every fixture uses an explicit implementation key: `expected.dynamo_v1`, `expected.dynamo_v2`, `expected.vllm_rust`, `expected.vllm_python`, `expected.sglang_python`. Dynamo v1 and v2 are separate impls with separate version lineages (`dynamo_v1-3.0.0/`, `dynamo_v2-0.1.11/`) — exactly like the vLLM/SGLang runtime variants. Legacy spellings (`dynamo`, `dynamo_rust`, `vllm`, `sglang`) are still accepted on read via the alias table in `utils/src/impls.py`.

Reasoning fixtures are rendered in the v2 HTML table; a Rust fixture harness for reasoning is still a follow-up.

## Refreshing Legacy Fixtures (v1)

Parser fixture sync from Dynamo is retired. Update v1 fixtures through normal frontend-crates PRs and verify the renderers listed in [`../docs/PARSERS-V2-MIGRATION-PLAN.md`](../docs/PARSERS-V2-MIGRATION-PLAN.md#temporary-sync-commands).

## Adding Streaming Parser V2 Fixtures

Use [`../parsers_v2/README.md`](../parsers_v2/README.md#fixture-files-to-add) for the parser-side checklist. In conformance, a new streaming family normally needs YAML files under `toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/<family>/` and `toolcalling/fixtures-batch-on-stream-v2/<family>/`; add `toolcalling/fixtures-batch-v1/<family>/` entries only when the v1 batch corpus does not already contain that family or taxonomy case. Capture locally with `capture.sh`, then run `package_fixtures.py` to rebuild the LFS shard store + manifest, and commit both — do not commit loose fixture YAMLs to the repo.

The v2 stream fixture schema is documented in [`toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/README.md`](toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/README.md). Capture and render commands are documented in [`utils/README.md`](utils/README.md).

## Fixture Workflows

The four routine loops. All of them end the same way: `package_fixtures.py` rebuilds the LFS shard store + manifest, and you commit `conformance/fixtures/` + `conformance/fixtures-manifest.json` together (see [`utils/README.md`](utils/README.md#fixture-store-git-lfs)).

### 1. Capture a new vLLM/SGLang engine version (new peer shards)

1. Pin the new engine version in `utils/src/pyproject.stub.toml` — peer versions are read from there, never hardcoded.
2. Re-capture against containers running the new engines: `capture.sh stream` / `capture.sh batch-on-stream` (peer-only refresh of the batch-on-stream tree: `recapture_batch_on_stream.py`, which preserves the `vllm_rust`/`dynamo_v2` blocks).
3. Captures land as a NEW `<impl>-<newver>/` dir next to the existing ones — never edit or delete old version dirs. Lowest dir = full anchor, higher dirs = changed-only overlays; `resolve_*.py` folds them at read time.
4. `package_fixtures.py` → a new `<impl>-<newver>.tar.gz` shard appears in the store; existing shards are untouched (byte-identical rebuilds thanks to deterministic tars). Commit store + manifest.
5. Nothing else to wire up: the next `render_table_v2.sh` / `cargo test` runs `extract_fixtures.py` automatically and follows the manifest pin (re-extracts on a pin move, retargets the cache symlinks, instant on a hit), and the generator discovers the new `<impl>-<newver>` dir as a new candidate column with its version label taken from fixture provenance.

### 2. Fix a Dynamo parser and refresh its expected outputs

1. Fix the code under `parsers/v1/` or `parsers/v2/`.
2. `cargo test --workspace` — if the fix changes output, the parity tests FAIL. That is the regression gate working: decide whether the diff is a bug in your fix or an intended behavior change.
3. For an intended change: bump the crate version first (workflow 3), re-capture the Dynamo fixtures (`capture.sh dynamo-stream` / `dynamo-batch-on-stream`; v1 batch `expected.dynamo_v1` blocks are updated through the same capture flow), then `package_fixtures.py`.
4. Commit the parser fix + fixture shards + manifest + `Cargo.toml` bump in the SAME PR. CI is green only when the code and the pinned expectations agree again.

### 3. Version rule: fixture dirs carry the crate version that ships them

Capture stamps versions from the crates themselves — version dirs (`dynamo_v1-<ver>/`, `dynamo_v2-<ver>/`) and `captured_with.*` fields are read from `Cargo.toml` at capture time. So when a parser fix changes captured output, bump `parsers/v1/Cargo.toml` or `parsers/v2/Cargo.toml` to the NEXT release version BEFORE capturing. The new fixture dirs then carry exactly the version crates.io publishes when the PR merges (the manual-peg flow in [`../RELEASING.md`](../RELEASING.md#manual-version-peg-fixture-synced-releases)): outputs and release stay on one number by construction. Never rename or delete an old version dir — a re-record ADDS a dir.

### 4. What CI actually checks (the regression gate)

The `rust` CI job checks out the LFS store (`lfs: true`), extracts the manifest-pinned snapshot, and runs the parity tests — current parser code vs pinned expected YAML:

- `parity_toolcalling`: v1 code vs `expected.dynamo_v1` in the `dynamo_v1-<ver>/` dir of `fixtures-batch-v1`.
- `parity_toolcalling_stream`: v2 code vs `expected.dynamo_v2` folded from the LOWEST `dynamo_v2-<ver>/` dir — the v2 anchor. (The v1-jail reference lives in its own `dynamo_v1-3.0.0/` namespace and never enters the v2 fold. Overlay folding up to the pinned crate version is a follow-up; until then an intended v2 output change must be reflected in the anchor's expected blocks at re-capture.)
- `parity_toolcalling_batch_via_stream`: v2 code vs the `fixtures-batch-on-stream-v2` expectations.

A parser change that alters output fails CI until the fixtures are re-captured and committed (workflow 2) — CI compares Dynamo against the pinned shard YAMLs, nothing else. The `conformance-table` CI job additionally re-renders both HTML pages from the same pinned store and runs the chart-invariant guards (`utils/tests/test_chart_invariants.py`).

### 5. Add a new test case (e.g. a new `TOOLCALLING.streamv2.5.h`)

A "case" is one `<num>.<letter>` sub-case shared across families. Adding one is FOUR edits, in order:

1. **Input.** Add the case to `toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/inputs/<family>/TOOLCALLING.streamv2.<N>.yaml` for each family it applies to — the shared per-chunk `delta_text` (schema in [`toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/README.md`](toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/README.md#fixture-schema)). Batch cases go under `toolcalling/fixtures-batch-v1/inputs/<family>/` instead.
2. **Description.** Add a bullet to `utils/lib/parsers/TOOLCALLING_STREAMING_V2_CASES.md` (or the batch/reasoning CASES.md) — the HTML "Case descriptions" section renders it, and the tooltip links to it.
3. **Grouping (easy to miss).** Add the case id to its band in **`utils/src/fixtures.py`** `BATCH_SUB_CASE_GROUPS` (the streamv2 tab reuses the batch taxonomy). If you skip this, the column still renders but sorts to the FAR RIGHT as an "unknown" case instead of beside its `<num>.*` siblings. **The same list is duplicated in `utils/tests/parity/toolcalling/table.py` — edit BOTH** (the v2 render reads `fixtures.py`'s copy; the v1 parity page reads `table.py`'s). TODO: dedup these into one shared table so a case is one edit; until then a new `<num>.<letter>` should ideally key on its parent `<num>`, not enumerate every letter.
4. **Capture + package.** `refresh_dynamo_captures.py stream` (records the Dynamo v2 output for the new case), then `package_fixtures.py`, then commit store + manifest. Peer engines (vLLM/SGLang) only cover the new case once re-captured against containers (workflow 1); until then the peer cells read `(no expectation)`.

### 6. Backfill an OLD parser version onto a new case (`.patchN` overlays)

To show what an already-released parser version would have produced on a case that didn't exist at its release (e.g. render Dynamo v2 `0.1.11`'s behavior on the new `5.h`), WITHOUT rewriting the pristine `0.1.11` shard:

1. Build the old binary: `git worktree add <path> <release-commit>` (find it via `git log -S'version = "0.1.11"' -- '**/Cargo.toml'`), then `cargo build -p dynamo-parsers-v2 --bin record_dynamo_stream` there.
2. Run that binary on the new-case input, and write the result into a NEW dir named `dynamo_v2-<ver>.patchN/` (`captured_with: <ver>.patchN`) — a full copy of the base `<ver>` capture plus the backfilled case. The pristine `dynamo_v2-<ver>/` shard stays byte-identical.
3. `package_fixtures.py` → a `dynamo_v2-<ver>.patchN.tar.gz` shard. Commit.

How `.patchN` is treated: **HTML** folds it into its base `<ver>` display column (it's the same binary, just re-run — `_base_stream_version` / `_impl_version_families` in `generate_conformance_table.py`), so it is NOT a separate candidate. **Parity tests** EXCLUDE `.patchN` dirs entirely (`version_dirs_ascending` in `tests/common/mod.rs`) — they validate the CURRENT parser, and a `.patchN` is an old binary that must never shadow the latest capture.

### 7. Classify a v1-batch vs v2-stream difference (`known-divergences.yaml`)

`parity_toolcalling_batch_via_stream` compares the v2 stream parser on batch text against v1's `expected.dynamo_v1`. v1 and v2 differ **by design** (v2 preserves surrounding/inter-call prose that v1 batch trims; v2 recovers bare calls v1 drops). When a case legitimately diverges, add it to `toolcalling/known-divergences.yaml` under `<family> → TOOLCALLING.batch.<case> → stream_vs_batch: <note>` (reuse the `*svb-surrounding-text` / `*svb-recovery` anchors). An entry with a note is an allowed, documented difference; a MISSING entry fails the test — so the file is also the audit trail of "v2 improved on v1 here." Do NOT add an entry to paper over an actual regression (v2 dropping text, leaking markup, corrupting args) — fix the parser instead.

### Invariants the tooling now enforces (so you don't have to remember)

- **Renders/tests read the manifest-pinned snapshot dir directly**, not the shared `<cache>/toolcalling` symlink — sibling `frontend-crates*` checkouts pinning other snapshots used to race to repoint it, so a render could read a snapshot missing the newest version. Enforced in `utils/src/_common.sh`.
- **`package_fixtures.py` recomputes the sha256 of every kept shard from disk**, never copying the prior manifest's value — a restored/re-pinned store file can no longer produce a manifest that lies about its content (which broke `extract_fixtures`' sha-verify).
